# diameter-of-binary-tree

### 原题： https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

这种问题的特点： 结果有两种情况： 1. 当前node的左右两边   2. 只取最长的一边，返回上层递归

```c#
public class Solution {
    int max = 0;
    public int DiameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        DFS(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    int DFS(TreeNode node){
        if(node == null) return 0;
        
        int leftDepth = Depth(node.left);
        int rightDepth = Depth(node.right);
        
        max = Math.Max(max, leftDepth + rightDepth);
        
        return Math.Max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
}

```
